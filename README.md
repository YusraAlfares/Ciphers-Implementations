# CiphersImplementations

## Overview
This Python code will include different types of popular encyrption \ decryption algorithms, including Vigenere cipher, Playfair cipher. 
And Diffie hellman key exchange algorithm.

## Course details
This course was about information security , where I learned different types of algorithms like Vigenere, Playfair, AES and DES, and many more topics. 
I also learned different types of attacks on a deeper level, like Dos and DDos attacks, etc.
